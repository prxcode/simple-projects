Password Manager
This program is made with Python and MySQL.

INTRODUCTION
The objective of this project is to create an effective Password Manager. This project has a variety of functions, including:

Store and manage passwords for different services
Organize passwords into categories for easy retrieval
Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security
Generate strong and unique usernames/passwords
Security
RSA Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using RSA encryption, providing robust security for user data.
Master Password: Users must enter a master password to access the application, adding an extra layer of security.
Users can also check the strength of their passwords.
This project uses MySQL-Connector for Python, allowing access, modification, and creation of MySQL databases from Python. While adding records, users can specify details such as the service name, username, password, email, and remarks. Records can be viewed directly in the database, but passwords are not visible for privacy. Upon opening the Password Manager, users must enter the correct master password to connect to the MySQL server, which helps avoid unauthorized access. After authentication, users are greeted by the main page, where they can proceed with the desired functions.

IN DETAIL
In an increasingly digital world where security breaches and data leaks have become common, the need for robust and reliable password management solutions is evident. As individuals and organizations grapple with maintaining numerous online accounts, each requiring unique and complex passwords, the demand for a streamlined and secure method of password organization has grown exponentially. The Password Manager aims to address this pressing need by developing a comprehensive and user-friendly password management system. This system provides users with a centralized platform to store, generate, and manage their passwords, enhancing both security and convenience. By incorporating state-of-the-art encryption techniques and advanced security protocols, it aims to mitigate vulnerabilities associated with traditional password storage methods, such as written notes or easily forgettable passwords.

This project will cater to a wide range of users, from individuals seeking to safeguard their personal online accounts to businesses aiming to fortify their cybersecurity infrastructure. The Password Manager is designed to strike a balance between usability and security, ensuring that users can easily access their passwords while maintaining high standards of data protection. Throughout this project, we will explore the intricacies of password management, encryption algorithms, user authentication mechanisms, and intuitive user interface design. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and best practices, the Password Manager will provide a versatile solution adaptable to various platforms and devices, including desktop computers, smartphones, and tablets. As we embark on developing the Password Manager, we are committed to delivering a tool that meets users' immediate password management needs while laying the foundation for a more secure digital future. Through continuous refinement, rigorous testing, and close collaboration with cybersecurity experts, our goal is to create a password management solution that instills confidence in users, allowing them to navigate the digital landscape with peace of mind.

Features
Command-line interface (CLI) style
Easy to access 'help' command
Generation
Choose the length of the password
Fine-tune the complexity of the password
Ability to generate usernames to prevent revealing real information
Managing Accounts
Add email, username, and password
Ability to add 2-factor authentication 'secret' key to prevent the need for an application like Google Authenticator
Option to add 'notes' like recovery codes
